# Cloudflare Pages SPA (Single Page Application) Routing Configuration
# This file tells Cloudflare Pages to serve index.html for ALL routes
# so React Router can handle client-side routing properly.
#
# Without this file, routes like /token, /adaptive-mfa, etc. would return 404
# because Cloudflare looks for physical files/folders that don't exist.
#
# HOW TO UPLOAD TO CLOUDFLARE PAGES:
# 1. Run: npm run build
# 2. Go to your dist/ folder
# 3. Select ALL contents (Ctrl+A): assets folder, index.html, and _redirects
# 4. Drag and drop ALL FILES TOGETHER at once to Cloudflare Pages
# 5. DO NOT upload files separately - this breaks the structure!
#
# The rule below means: "For any route (/*), serve /index.html with 200 status"
/*    /index.html   200
